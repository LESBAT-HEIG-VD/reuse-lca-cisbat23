            <h2>Building life cycle with reuse</h2>
            <p>
                The SIA 2032:2020 standard for LCA of building and construction products does not have a specific calculation method for reusing components. A workshop was held in November 2021 in Zurich with the Reuse-LCA project partners and Katrin Pf√§ffli (ETHZ architect) to discuss extending the SIA standard to reuse practices. Various calculation methodologies were compared on the K118 building transformation case study in Winterthur. They reached a consensus on a methodology called "current processes", which involves describing and assessing all processes in the waste-to-reuse product supply chain, including dismantling, transport, storage, preparation, and modifications. The LCA calculation does not consider previous manufacturing or amortization of the initial LCA related to the product's age. The next figure illustrates the LCA ‚Äúcurrent processes‚Äù method according to the outcome of the Reuse-LCA workshop. The green arrow represents the activities involved in reusing a building component. The method accounts for different aspects specific to reuse activities that are described below.

            <h2>LCA of the reused components supply-chains</h2>
            <p>
                The LCA methodology is proposed in the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) Reuse-LCA project as an adaptation of the SIA 2032 and SIA 2040 technical books calculation rules and the building life cycle stages from EN 15978. The A1 to A3 modules of a building‚Äôs product stage are adapted to be representative of the supply chain of a reused component. A component that is identified for reuse cannot be qualified as a waste, and all the activities of the following supply chain, including dismantling, are attributed to the building life cycle that will reuse the component [5]. The potential activities of a reuse supply chain and the building life cycle modules to which they are assigned are depicted in the next figure.

                From its dismantling to its effective reuse in a new building, a reused component may see losses that end up as waste. Therefore, differentiating the 	amounts of material along the supply chain is necessary to avoid the risk of overestimating the potential benefits of reuse and missing burdens from the waste treatment of potential losses. Material flow tracing can be challenging to document because of the diversity of actors involved along the supply chain, but it is a key aspect to promote material efficiency with finite existing material stocks. Figure 2 presents an illustrative Sankey diagram of the amounts of materials from before dismantling to effective reuse in a new building.

            <h2>LCA of avoided activities due to reuse</h2>
            <p>
                Besides reducing the impacts of the effective supply chain of a building project, reuse allows extending the service life of an already existing components. Hence, it prevents the waste treatment and the production of a new component that would provide an equivalent function or service. These consequences happen beyond the system boundary of the reused component itself. In the proposed methodology, additional LCA indicators are presented to inform about the avoided waste management and avoided production associated to reuse, analogous to the D module defined in EN 15978.
